# Derivatives
Note: these will also include proofs
## Derivative definition
$\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$
### Proof: Differentiability implies continuity
## Constant rule
$\frac{d}{dx}(c) = 0$
## Constant multiple rule
## Sum/Difference rule
## Chain rule
## sin(x), cos(x)
## e<sup>x</sup>
## ln(x)
Proof: Go to "Implicit differentiation"
## Product/Quotient rule
## tan(x), cot(x), sec(x), cosec(x)
## Chain rule
### Exponentials
## Implicit differentiation
## Inverse functions
### Inverse trigs
