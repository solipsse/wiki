# UPDATE!

I have decided to stop developing this knowledge base as I have found a nicer library for static site generation which is Astro rather than MKDocs. I also found myself with problem in writing document for static site generation and is looking forward to building a content management software (CMS) and make sure support to all technical necessity in writing, such as LaTeX, mermaid for diagram, better code block and many more.
